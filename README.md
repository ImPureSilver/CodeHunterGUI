# CodeHunterGUI
This is part two in modernizing Code Hunter to become much more useful

# What has changed?
Here, I have designed the GUI in the most appealing way I could without
sacrificing any of the functionality from the orinal from the terminal version.

# Next Steps going forward...
My job is to make it possible to turn this into a
desktop application like it was meant to be.
